OpenFOAM actuator surface simulation
====================================
by [Pete Bachant](http://petebachant.me)

These case files simulate a cylindrical actuator surface--to mimic a vertical axis turbine--in a towing tank.
Note that there may be significant modifications to `processing.py` necessary for it to work on other
systems.
